# medium-clap


## Introduction

> Reading Medium articles is my main way of staying up to date with the current trends in Software Engineering. To show my appreciation for the authors, I usually clap an article 50 times (the maximum number of claps allowed by Medium). To clap an article 50 times you can either click on the clap button 50 times or click and hold the clap button until the clap count goes up to 50. This makes clapping an article 50 times a bit bothersome so I decided to look into automating the process. I created this Chrome extension to allow me to clap an article once and the extension will do the remaining claps until the maximum clap of 50.

## How To Use
